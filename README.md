       ## Face Detection with Qt5 and OpenCV
</p>

## Overview 

This project used HAARCASCADE classifier to detect faces, using OpenCV, and C++.
The goal is to be able to detect a face and store the image every time a face is detected.

## Before building 

- Please make sure that you have :

|:---:| :---: |
| Opencv | 4.5.2 |
| Qt | 5.12

</div>

## Notice :
The project only works in release !

You can use these steps in order to install OpenCV with CUDA and CuDNN.

This project does not require cuda toolkit to function but you can install it for future needs. If you want to install OpenCV 
with GPU enabled. You need to have an NVIDIA Card, and CUDA, and CuDNN installed.
You can find these libraries at NVIDIA's webpage.
